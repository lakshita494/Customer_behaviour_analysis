Customer Behaviour Analysis: End-to-End Data Pipeline
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer patterns and trends by building a complete data analytics pipeline. The workflow includes data ingestion and cleaning in Python, structured storage in SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL), and interactive visualization through Power BI. The final insights are presented in a professional report and an AI-generated presentation.

🛠 Tech Stack
Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Database Management: PostgreSQL & MySQL.

Database Connectivity: SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2, and PyMySQL.

Business Intelligence: Power BI.

Reporting & Presentation: Gamma AI & MS Word.

🚀 Workflow Stages
1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning (Python)
Loaded raw customer datasets into Python using the Pandas library.

Performed data cleaning by addressing missing values, removing duplicate records, and correcting data types.

Executed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover correlations and behavioral trends.

2. Database Schema & Migration (SQL)
Established secure connections to SQL servers using SQLAlchemy engines.

Designed a structured schema specifically for customer_behavior.

Automated the migration of cleaned DataFrames into SQL tables for optimized querying.

3. Business Intelligence & Visualization (Power BI)
Integrated the SQL database with Power BI to ensure a single source of truth.

Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures using DAX.

Created interactive dashboards to visualize customer segments, purchase frequency, and sales trends.

4. Professional Reporting & Presentation
Synthesized complex analytical findings into a clear, recruiter-friendly report.

Leveraged Gamma AI to generate a high-impact presentation for stakeholders.

📈 Key Deliverables
Analysis-Ready Dataset: A refined version of the raw data optimized for modeling.

Relational SQL Database: A structured system for reliable data storage and retrieval.

Interactive Dashboard: A visual tool for real-time monitoring of customer metrics.

Stakeholder Presentation: A summary of actionable business insights.
